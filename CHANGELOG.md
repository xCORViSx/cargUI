## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-13

### ‚ú® Library Target Support

**Added:**
- **Full library target support** - Auto-detects `src/lib.rs` and `[lib]` sections in Cargo.toml
- **Keyboard shortcuts now work with library-only crates** - No more broken shortcuts in library projects!
- **Star icon (‚≠ê) indicators** - Primary targets (`src/main.rs` and `src/lib.rs`) are marked with stars
- **Auto-selection fallback** - When no targets are checked, commands automatically use `src/lib.rs` if `src/main.rs` doesn't exist
- **Module counts** - MODULES category and all subcategories now show direct children counts
- **Submodule counts** - Module counts display at all nesting levels
- **View Member's Cargo.toml** - New context menu option for workspace members

**Improved:**
- **Optimized command generation** - Removed redundant `--bin` flags for `src/main.rs` (default binary target)
- **Library color coding** - `src/lib.rs` no longer shows blue warning (it's the default library path)
- **Selected member indicator** - Workspace members now show star icon (‚≠ê) for currently selected member

**Fixed:**
- Duplicate library detection in workspace members
- Path resolution bug in "View Member's Cargo.toml" command
